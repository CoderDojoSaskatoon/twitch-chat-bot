## Setting Up Your Environment

- You may want to install a package manager to help you download the programs you need for this project. I like Homebrew (https://brew.sh/). Follow the setup instructions to download and install it from your terminal program (I like to use iTerm2: https://www.iterm2.com/)
- Next, you will need to install Node. If you downloaded and installed brew, you can run `brew install node`. Check that node has been installed properly by running `node --version`
- You may also want to install a code editor. It doesn't matter which one you like to use, any will work. I like Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), but Atom or another will work fine.
- Once you download this code using `git clone` or the download link. Install the Node packages you need by running `npm install`
